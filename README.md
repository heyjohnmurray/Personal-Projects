# Personal-Projects
This is a list of personal projects that I want to do to increase my skills.

* Lightbox plugin for Jacob
* Some sort of Spanish flash card application
* ["What to wear" / personal stylist application] (http://ideasource.blankdots.com/2012/11/what-to-wear-today-app/) that picks out clothes for you
* [Mobile prescription app] (http://ideasource.blankdots.com/2014/01/mobile-prescription/)
